## Abstract:

In our research paper we touched and presented Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma as proposed by Axelrod
in a number of his works. We developed our own strategy to compete in the tournament setting and
also included Finite State Machines (FSMs) of various sizes, which we considered as a viable mind
model for discovering optimal strategies. FSM Strategies were obtained through simulated evolution.
In this work, we present our methodology and our observations.
